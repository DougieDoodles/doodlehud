============================================================================


About:
-----------------------
DoodleHUD is a custom TF2 HUD, created by Doodles.

More information: http://doodlesstuff.com/?stuff=doodlehud

Screenshots available at the above link.

Install:
-----------------------
1) Removing Old Custom HUDs

Other custom HUDs may conflict with DoodleHUD, so its a good idea to remove them. Other custom HUDs will be located in the custom directory as well

2) Open your TF2 custom folder

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

3) Create a "doodlehud" folder (or any name will do)

4) Move the "cfg", "resources", "scripts" and "overrides" folders into this newly created folder


Uninstall:
-----------------------
Delete the "doodlehud" folder from your team fortress 2 custom folder.
